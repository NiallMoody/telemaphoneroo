# Telemaphoneroo

An online telephone game, with some basic customisation options. The default
game asks players to start by writing 2 words, and on every subsequent turn,
asks them to add a single syllable to the 2-word phrase.

Custom settings allow the host to define their own prompts/game rules. This
makes it possible to create a variety of different games using the same basic
format. It turns out there's a lot you can do with the telephone game format!
